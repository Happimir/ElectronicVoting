Project was done for CSCI 4300: Software Engineering at the University of Georgia,
under professor Kochut. Backend is pure Java/java Servlets. Front end is HTML, CSS (Bootstrap),
and some Javascript where it was far more concise or doable than with Java. 

Final Grade: 100% because that is how we roll.
